### About me
I'm currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois studying artificial intelligence. My skills are mainly in the areas of software design.

Here are some of my projects that I have to show off! Some of these are in repositiories here on GitHub and you can check out the source code.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Demo with Minimax Opponent
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, whatever you want to call it.
This is a demo of an implementation I did which uses the minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning to pin you against a computer opponent.
Unfortunately for the human player, it is pretty much impossible to win. You can really only lose or tie here.
It's a testament to the power of AI! ...or optimized bruteforcing.
Either way, I think it's impressive!
