### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my GitHub page!

### About me
I'm currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois studying artificial intelligence. My skills are mainly in the areas of software design.
I mainly delve in Javascript/Typescript and Python but I am always learning more.

Here are some of my projects that I have to show off! Some of these are in repositiories here on GitHub and you can check out the source code.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Demo with Minimax Opponent
[Demo](https://frc.baxleys.org/MinimaxTicTacToe/)

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, whatever you want to call it.
This is a demo of an implementation I did which uses the minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning to pin you against a computer opponent.
Unfortunately for the human player, it is pretty much impossible to win. You can really only lose or tie here.
It's a testament to the power of AI! ...or optimized bruteforcing.
Either way, I think it's impressive!

### Sheep Game
[Demo](https://frc.baxleys.org/sheepGame/)

Sheep Game is a game whose eventual goal is to be similar to the hit Nintendo game **Super Smash Bros**.
The goal is to eventually have a slew of characters with different abilities and a plethora of items that make the game it's own and stand out.
It's a game that I'm always getting new ideas for and it feels good to be able to actually implement them.

At this point it might look like something you could find on a youtube tutorial titled "how to make a platformer video game in 1 hour" but I assure you there is more to it than that.
Behind the scenes it is my most complex project and I expect it to keep getting more so.
It's got it's own version of a physics engine, I'm working on multiplayer for online (already local), it's got controller support, and I've got so much more planned for it.

This is something I'm rather proud of if I'm being honest. It's a game that I've worked on for some time now and it's gone through a few revisions since I started working on it.
I've learned a lot in college and in other projects along the way that I can apply to it and it's exciting that I get to apply my new knowledge to something I feel strongly about.
