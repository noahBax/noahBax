## About me
I'm currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois studying artificial intelligence. My skillset is largely in software design.
I am most experienced in JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS and Python, but I am always learning more.

## What I've Done
Let me show you some of my projects! Some of these are in repositories here on GitHub and you can check out the source code.

### Tetris Artificial Intelligence
[Demo](https://frc.baxleys.org/Tetris/) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/noahBax/Tetris-AI-Trainer)

The demo links to a Tetris AI that I built. I trained my AI using an unsupervised genetic algorithm that I wrote in C++.
This was something small I did just to prove to myself that I could, but it is also something cool I want to show off.
If I'm being honest though, I built this to overcompensate for my lack of actual skill at Tetris.

### Tic-Tac-Toe with Artificial Intelligence Opponent
[Demo](https://frc.baxleys.org/MinimaxTicTacToe/) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/noahBax/Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe-Implementation)

This is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe I created which uses the minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning to pin you against a computer opponent.
Unfortunately for the human player, it is pretty much impossible to win. While it is a simple algorithm in concept, it is very efficient at what it
does. You can really only lose or tie. Feel free to try though...

### Sheep Game: A Multiplayer Online Fighting Game

Sheep Game is a game that I'm designing to be similar to the Nintendo game "Super Smash Bros".
It might be lofty, but the goal is to eventually have a slew of characters with different abilities and a plethora of items that make the game its own and stand out.
It's one of my longer term projects and it's something that I'm always getting new ideas for, and it feels good to be able to actually implement them somewhere like this.



<!--At this point it might look like something you could find on a youtube tutorial titled "how to make a platformer video game in 1 hour" but I assure you there is more to it than that.
Behind the scenes it is my most complex project and I expect it to keep getting more so.
It's got it's own version of a physics engine, I'm working on multiplayer for online (already local), it's got controller support, and I've got so much more planned for it.

This is something I'm rather proud of if I'm being honest. It's a game that I've worked on for some time now and it's gone through a few revisions since I started working on it.
I've learned a lot in college and in other projects along the way that I can apply to it and it's exciting that I get to apply my new knowledge to something I feel strongly about.-->
